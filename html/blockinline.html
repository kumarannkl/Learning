        <div style="background-color:red;
        color:white;padding:20px;text-align:center">Hello World</div>
        <p>The P and the DIV elements are 
            both block elements and they will 
            always start on a new line and take 
            up the full width available
            (stretches out to the left and
            right as far as it can).
        </p>
        <p>This is an inline span <span
        style="color:orchid;font-weight:bold;">
         muchas gracias
      </span> </p>
        <p>The SPAN element is an inline 
            element,and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much
            width as necessary.
        </p>
